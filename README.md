# Oral Tissues Segmentation
### Project Name : Comprehensive Segmentation Algorithms for Oral Images
This repository Oral Tissues Segmentation is my master's degree Thesis that using Segmentation models to Segment oral tissue in oral images into 8 parts include :(Oral mucosa, Lips, Tongue, teeth, Floor of Mouth, Gingiva, Others Inside and Background)

Experiment Objective:
(1) Developing deep learning models for segmenting oral tissues into 8 elements (tissues). 
(2) Locating the oral tissue in oral images to narrow the area for consideration. 
(3) Testing the hypothesis if the oral cropping algorithm has an effect on the efficiency of oral tissue segmentation. 
(4) Testing the hypothesis if the image resizing may affect theoral tissue segmentation performance.

Each objective corresponds to one experiment, so this research will comprise a total of 4 experiments.
